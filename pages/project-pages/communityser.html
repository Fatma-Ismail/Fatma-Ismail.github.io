                <p>This poster was designed to raise the awareness around sexual harassment.</p>
                <p><strong>Concept</strong>
                    <br>Showing the mental and physical impact of sexual harassment</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges </strong>
                    <br>Communicating the message with a minimalist graphical approach.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Visual Strategy</strong>
                    <br>I represented both verbal and physical forms ofsexual harassment by illustrating the harasser's hand with phrases commonly used to objectify women. Additionally the hand is rendered in red with sharp fingers reminiscent of a devil's hand to drive home the message that harassment is a terrible crime. Furthermore, it give emphasis and visual interest to that portion of the composition. The stop in the title was set in red and in the center to grab people's attention.</p>
                <p><strong>Connotation</strong>
                    <br>Minimal, modern and engaging
                    <br>&nbsp;</p>
