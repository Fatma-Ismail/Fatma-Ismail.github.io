Company's Story:
In 2013 a young couple migrated from Egypt to San Frantokyo. Soon after they arrived they started a pursuit trying to find food that carried the flavor of their home country, but they never really found what they were looking for. Instead, they started thinking of ways to reproduce these flavors with the best locally sourced ingredients offered by their new community. Their pursuit finally led them to creating a dish that is served mainly during Ramadan called “Sambosa”, mainly consisting of spring rolls wrapped with middle eastern spices and filled with delicious melted cheese and olives. The Sambosa dish was so delicious that friends in the community started asking the couple to offer these Sambosa online in frozen form, and hence Sambosa Gal came to life.
